									<h3 class="major">Week 1</h3>
									<p>After a 12 hour trek that involved a bus breakdown and a pass-through of Mikumi national park, I arrived in Iringa safe and sound.  Although there was no running water at the time, I was happy to finally settle in and relax.  The following day, I helped the head of my physics department build a "local fence".  It consisted of a wooden skeleton (already in place) that we attached dense bushels of hay to via thin wires.  At one point I joked that not even the US military could pass through it.  I was kindly reminded that you could destroy it with a single match.  I don't think my teacher got my joke.  We retired for the evening to have dinner at his house.  Funny enough, his wife had prepared my two least favorite foods in Tanzania, ugali and dagaa.  Ugali is a mixture of corn meal and water that looks similar to mashed potatoes but is a little denser and a whole lot less flavorful.  Dagaa are tiny dried fish that can be put into sauces to make them taste horrible.  I loathe dagaa.  My teacher's wife was kind enough to quickly make some peas and rice for me when it was uncovered that "I don't like dagaa that much".  When I returned, I heard the sound of my running water and was filled with excitement.</p>

									<p>In the following and less eventful days of the week, I watched premier league soccer with a few of my teachers, prepared some PowerPoint slides for my first lessons, and made my best attempts socialize with teachers.  I also found a running buddy this week! Guess we're going to start running in the mornings at 5:30am ... yikes.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Week 2</h3>
                                                                        <p>We're going to start this week with the weekend.  I went to a wedding!  No, not the wedding of one of my teachers but one of Lindsay's teachers.  Lindsay is another volunteer and very close friend of mine.  We were treated to kiti moto, or fried pork.  It's my favorite food in Tanzania, hands down.  As we ate our food and had a few drinks, I chatted with her teachers.  They were all extremely friendly and happy to talk to me in Swahili.  Talking to them seemed simpler than talking to most of the teachers at my school.  I figure the reason is because I'm more cautious around people who I will see nearly every day for the next two years (makes sense).  A lady who was sitting with us bought me two beers, and to Lindsay and my surprise, we found out she wasn't part of our wedding party.  She was just pretty drunk and liked talking to us. After changing, going to a bar to catch a few more drinks, and waiting around for a while, we were at the wedding!  It was a wonderful venue and I had a blast letting loose and dancing like a fool.  Weddings here are long and unpredictable, but all things considered, we had a great time.  After returning to my site at maybe 2:00am, we were all ready to call it a night.  Lindsay stayed the following day to hang out.  We chatted, adventured around Iringa town, and concluded the day by making spinach fettuccine that was both time consuming and delicious.  The weekend was a smashing success!</p>

                                                                        <p>On Monday just about 30 minutes before my first class started, we realized that there was no way to connect my computer to the projector.  I was disappointed because I had spent countless hours making a neat presentation with nice visual aids.  Also, I despise chalky hands.  Instead of screaming and complaining, I think I did the right thing and just simply taught with chalk.  It was tough to do so in a cramped class with limited Swahili skills, but it didn't go as poorly as I might have expected given the conditions.  I teach two different sections of all-boy 18-20 year old students.  One class has 95 students and the other has 142, so needless to say it gets pretty crowded, hot, and smelly.  The coming weekend's goals are to buy a HDMI chord so that I can stop using this grimy chalk.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Week 3</h3>
                                                                        <p>I stayed home for the weekend!  I guess I wanted to test out what loneliness felt like.  It was fairly relaxing, only got a little restless.  However, I did get my social fix by watching premier league football (I call it that now I guess) with my fellow teachers.  During halftime of one of the earlier games, I decided to check out a nice overlook on top of one of the academic buildings.  I had heard about the spot from a PCV who had visited the previous volunteer at my site.  Not only was could you see an amazing view of the school and entire area, but I realized that falcons live at my site.  And they like to hunt!  My site sits atop a large, fairly isolated hill, so it gets some hefty wind gusts. The falcons can practically sit on the air by perfectly controlling their body’s orientation.  With one small change of their body angle, they sweep to a completely different region of the sky.  Watching them was nothing short of stunning.  This widow’s peak on top of the biology building will surely be a go-to spot for stress relief.</p>

                                                                        <p>I finally got to start teaching with the projector and my computer!  As per recommendation by the previous volunteer at my site, I downloaded a neat program called “OpenBoard” that allows me to use my touchscreen computer as a blackboard (imagine Khan Academy).  The students got very excited when I first used it...I hope they still payed attention to my lesson.  Not only did I teach my regular four weekly double periods (80 minutes), but I also taught my first night sessions.  For every unit, I have determined that I will teach one evening review session to cover material they might see on a national exam.  For an added bonus, students who come to these optional lessons get to watch 15-30 minutes of Planet Earth II after we finish all the material. Lastly, on Friday mornings, there is a neat little school assembly.  Highlights of each school assembly include:  the national anthem, a patriotic song, the school song, the scouts (similar to boy scouts) putting on some sort of a show, results from the dorm cleanliness tests, and some student speeches.  This week the scouts marched, did push-ups, and karate chopped clay blocks like Bruce Lee.  It was awesome. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Week 4</h3>

                                                                        <p>This week I’m just going to focus on sports.  One of the younger teachers invited me to play volleyball with him this week.  He was much better than me.  One time, the ball rolled off to the side.  I ran to collect it and tried to kick it back with a clever little chip.  In order to chip the ball you need to hit the ball very low and hard with your toe.  I missed the ball and drilled a rock.  I still think theres a 15% chance I might have broken it.  Power through though am I right?   After some deal of rest, I attempted to teach the students how to play Frisbee.  It was unsuccessful mostly due to the heavy winds.  After the Frisbee hit a dry rocky surface at a sharp angle a few times in a row, I retired to my house.  I didn’t want it to break the same way that my last one broke in Korogwe.  My last sport to try was basketball.  I never realized how ingrained basketball was into American culture until I played in a country where basketball is not popular.  It helps that I’m above average height too.  Needless to say, I’m pretty sure I rack up a triple double about every other game.   I think basketball will be my sport here. </p>
