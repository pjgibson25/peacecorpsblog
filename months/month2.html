 <h3 class="major">Around the School</h3>


<p> School this month pretty much continued on as normal.  I taught the topics of Simple Harmonic Motion and Surface Tension.  Then I started Elasticity!  I also set up a few nifty computer programs to help me in the workplace, something I really enjoy doing.  All Tanzanian teachers are required to write lesson plans which can be long and tedious.  Additionally, if you teach the same lesson to two different groups of students, that means you need to produce a nearly identical copy.  Therefore, I wrote a python program to merge a Microsoft Word Template with a text document containing a few specific details of the lesson.  Instead of spending up to 30 minutes writing by hand, I can knock out one in less than a minute now!  I also set up a database to analyze student test scores and produce a report.  The fellow physics teachers were very grateful and I think it saved a lot of time!</p>

<p>   Additional random note:  one time my coworker who I run with asked me to take some pictures of him in front of one of the academic buildings.  I did.  The best part of the situation was a different teacher photo-bombing him behind the glass door. </p>



<h3 class="major">Wedding</h3>

<p> One of my teachers got married!!  On day of the wedding at 9:00am, approximately 2 hours before the church ceremony was set to start, I get a knock on my door.  One of my teachers decided that we were going into town to play basketball.  So why not?  We took the hour ride into town, took another bus to a college, and then joined in a festivity of sports activities.  After warming up for over an hour because nobody else was going to play basketball, we eventually put a game together.  Everyone playing had an athletic build and was significantly taller than the average Tanzanian.  I held my own but certainly didn’t put on the Lebron-like performance that occasionally came out at Tosamaganga.  Afterwards, we played some volleyball.  We left around 1:30pm, which is shortly after the celebration was supposed to start.  I forgot sunscreen and resembled a perfectly ripe tomato.  When we arrived to Tosamaganga, I quickly showered and then changed into my freshest outfit.  I finally arrived at the wedding celebration at 4:00pm.  I was one of the first people there.  They were sooooooooo far behind schedule.  </p>

<p> Eventually people showed up.  After taking a pass on a Halloween party happening near Lindsay’s site, I was kind of looking forward to having a few drinks with my teachers.  The goody bags only had one beer.  All of the party teachers brought their own stuff.  Smart.  I passed on the singular beer, but still managed to whip out some killer dance moves.  It was so nice to let go around my teachers who I felt a little up tight around sometimes. </p>

<p> Apart from the head-achingly loud music, the celebration was beautiful (and long).  Speeches were made, different social groups were addressed, and gifts were danced down the aisle and presented to the couple.  Money donations were waved in the air as people danced them down the aisle as well.  This is perhaps the strangest of Tanzanian wedding celebration traditions coming from an American perspective.  While I sat in the crowd awkwardly understanding 20% of what was going on, I had a nice chance to think and reflect on how cool weddings are.  It’s pretty special how two people who love each other can take a massive step together in front of all their best friends.  Being present with your closest friends from different parts of your life is something special.  It reminded me of when my hometown best friends, Robby and Elijah, visited me in Oregon.  I had a chance to spend time with them alongside my Oregonian best friends, Maxwell and Annie.  Weddings are so unique!   </p>

<p> Perhaps the most touching part of the ceremony was a touching experience between the bride and her mother.  After acknowledging many of her friends and colleagues, the bride ended with her mother.  After a few nice words, they embraced and I saw the mother whisper something into her daughters ear.  Nobody heard what they said.  As the groom proceeded to go about other traditional duties, I noticed both the mother and the bride crying quietly, but not sad crying.  I can only imagine that whatever the mother said to her daughter was incredibly profound.  I could have interpreted the entire situation incorrectly.  But something about not knowing what was said made it even more beautiful.  As I imagined what words were exchanged, I started choking up.  What an incredible moment for both of them. </p>

<h3 class="major">Lindsay Hangouts</h3>

<p>  One week I visited Lindsay for her birthday, the next she came to visit me.  For her birthday, we originally had a plan to go horseback riding.  Lindsay and some of her volunteer friends in Mafinga have a nice friendship with some British folks doing work for UNISEF.  They have a large plot of property, a few houses, and apparently some horses.  We were going to phone in a birthday favor, but unfortunately plans didn’t work out.  Instead, we celebrated her birthday on the lake with a few other volunteers.  We had a few drinks, ate great food, and watched a beautiful sunset.  Not a bad birthday celebration at all.  </p>

<p>  Lindsay came to my place the next weekend!  Aside from making some pretty dank food, we had a day of hiking.  First, we explored the small river that runs a kilometer from my school.  We explored an area of Tosamaganga that I have never seen, and then we went on a hike with my elderly school electrician.  It was a gorgeous day.  Upon descending, we stopped by in a nearby village and were very adamantly encouraged to greet everyone in Kihehe, the local language.  After the village stop, we returned to my house and immediately went up to the perch (on top of the biology building).  We watched some of my students play a basketball game and witnessed a double rainbow.  Also, we could watch lightning in the distance.  It was a really fun weekend, and I am really thankful to have Lindsay as a best friend. </p>

<h3 class="major">Njombe Lake Day</h3>


<p>  Going to Njombe!  All of the volunteers in Iringa and other adjacent regions of Njombe were invited to a lake day party just outside of Njombe town.  I left on a Friday with my Iringa Town volunteer-friends, Karina and Brandy.  When we arrived, we dropped our stuff off and met a bunch of volunteers at a hotel-restaurant.  Out of the 15 volunteers there, I only knew 3.  One of them, Vern, was RePCV or volunteer during training, and the other 2 were the people I cam with!  I made some new friends but was secretly and patiently waiting for my friends Lindsay and Wesley to come.  Eventually they arrived and we had a couple drinks together.  That night, we got some nice rest in preparation for the next day, the party!</p> 

<p>  In total, there were 7 volunteers at Njombe Lake Day from my education cohort.  We all pitched in to have chapati with peanut butter, banana, and honey for lunch.  We also bought some meat to barbecue.  By we, I mean Wesley.  He bought a shitload of meat.  After many grocery errands and a taxi ride where we blasted Smash Mouth’s “All Star”, we arrived at the lake.  While I probably got Schistosomiasis by diving in the likely dirty lake, it felt pretty good.  I’m going to get a pill at the end of my service that would flush it out anyways so I think I’m good.  I made some new friends, had more than a couple of drinks, and even played cornhole!  Lindsay and I hung out a bunch, as we always do when subjected to large groups.  I also talked to Vern a decent amount and lent her my jacket when it started hailing.  I had a belly of meat and chapati sandwiches, mixed with cheap vodka and sprite to keep me warm anyways.  Because the weather turned into an extremely gnarly hailstorm, we switched locations to a bar in town.  The night ended with watching Princess Bride / Sandlot in Vern’s room with a few other volunteers.  Apparently Vern and I were annoying for quoting so much of the princess bride.  Returned to my house the next day and hit up Vern with a nice little voice message.  Boy, she sure made a mistake responding to me. </p>
