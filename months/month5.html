<h3 class="major">Visiting Vern</h3>


<p>To start off the month, I traveled to Njombe to visit Vern!  I left on Thursday and after meeting in Njombe Town in the late evening, we went out to a nice hotel-restaurant.  We ordered a less than authentic pad Thai, but still managed to have a lovely time.  We picked up some groceries in town on Friday morning and then Vern took me on a surprise/spontaneous picnic by a waterfall nearby.  We had wine and cheese at 11:00am until it started raining.  Njombe rain doesn’t mess around.  When it rains, it pours.  We trekked back in a downpour and caught a ride to her site.  The typically 2.5-3 hour trek was made longer by what we think was our driver’s mid-ride coitus break (no pun intended).  Additionally, we had a small vehicular accident that resulted in about an hour of discussion that involved about 15 people.  They would talk in small clusters and switch groups like speed dating.  An elderly woman in the front seat yelled at them to just hurry up, god bless her. We arrived in about 4 hours.  By the grace of good company, the ride wasn’t all that bad. </p>

<p>We deservingly had wine, cheese, and a pineapple for dinner.  The next day, we went on a run that kicked both of our asses, lamented on how we are about to die running a marathon, and made some peanut butter pancakes with nutella.  We had a nice talk at an overlook by her house and made some banana bread.  Don’t tell Vern, but my mom makes it better.  And if this is Vern, it was still delicious.  We had lots of honey-filled tea and had a wonderfully relaxing spa night with face masks and a large pot of water that we crammed our feet into.  I returned first thing in the morning and made it back to site in the early evening.  </p>


<h3 class="major">Teaching</h3>

<p>I started teaching this month again!  After a week of students “cleaning the environment” and another week of being sick, I was finally able to play my Jeopardy game!  I found an online website (using my phone’s hotspot) that allows you to create Jeopardy games.  I made a review one that included 3 serious categories and 3 fun categories.  It was a hit!  The next week, I began teaching as per normal. </p>

<p>I’m really excited to start presenting a physics/math fun fact to begin every class.  It gives me a chance to tap into my inner-nerd and attempt to make STEM subjects sound cool.  Spoiler alert, they are.  This introduction allows students to file in, learn cool facts, see pictures, and watch videos that hopefully stick with them.  Fun facts include:  </p>

<ul>
<li>  <b> Gravity makes you stronger – </b> astronauts need to work out to retain muscle mass </li>
<li>  <b> Space is big – </b> relative scales in our solar system </li>
<li>  <b> Why do people float – </b> the mechanics of jumping and time vs height plots </li>
<li>  <b> Grenade vs. Gun – </b> physical consequences of firearms on land and underwater </li>
<li>  <b> Pascal’s Triangle (1/2) – </b> the coolest mathematical phenomenon you will ever observe </li>
<li>  <b> Pascal’s Triangle (2/2) – </b> the coolest mathematical phenomenon you will ever observe </li>
<li>  <b> Clouds Part 1 – </b> Volume and Mass with comparisons to Old Trafford and Elephants </li>
<li>  <b> Clouds Part 2 – </b> Cloud Seeding and Operation Popeye (gotta look this one up too, it's WILD. </li>
</ul> 


<h3 class="major">Site for a Weekend</h3>

<p>I ran 14.7 miles on Friday and it felt awesome.  I greeted the locals that I passed in very rural areas nearby.  Got slightly intimidated by two dogs who did not like me, but the owner had my back.  I concluded my run at the soccer field to watch the students playing.  On the walk back, one of my favorite Form 6 students, James, showed face for the first time since before break.  He came to school late due to some unforeseen complications, but I was extremely happy to see him again.  </p>

<p>The next day I went into town by myself, hung out at the market briefly with my soko bro (Mika), and promptly returned back home.  I hung up Nora’s art that she sent me and a Neil Gaimen quote that the Wheeler’s sent me by my working desk.  Also hung up a sweet note Vern sent to me on the next wall over.  I worked into the night by candel-light and listened to music.  The next day, I worked… a lot.  I needed to finish my presentations for the upcoming week.  I took a break to film some Form 6 students dancing.  I told them I only had 30 minutes.  40 minutes after arriving when I said I would, they still weren’t ready.  I left them and hopefully they learned firsthand how frustrated some American’s can get by wasting time during a time crunch.  Particularly this American.   </p>

<p>The electricity was out the following Monday morning, so the countless hours I spent perfecting my powerpoint presentations were all for nothing.   I was flustered and upset, which leaked into my presentation.  I felt bad for not teaching the students as well as they deserved.  The electricity returned for my next class on Monday, so the day took a pleasant turn.  Seeing the students laughing at the Scott Sterling video (a stretched example of Fatigue) I downloaded really changed my mood. </p>

<h3 class="major">The day</h3>

<p>Someone once mentioned how a day in Peace Corps can be the roller roaster ride of a lifetime.  Found that out firsthand.  It was a Tuesday and I taught first thing (7:30am).  A student stayed after to ask me questions that had “kept him up night” about a topic I didn’t teach him.  After drawing a picture and somehow recalling the equations off the top of my head, I was able to get the right answer.  Then I had him repeat the work by himself.  It was one of those really great small moments in teaching that I like to hang on to.  I worked, taught again, and then had lunch.  I hung out with my counterpart, Kambo, for a little while and we observed some turtles in the school’s small greenhouse.   </p>

<p>After parting ways with Kambo, I was invited to sit with some Form 6 students.  They gave me really interesting insight to what life is like for a ~21 year old boy in Tanzania.  They discussed school dynamics between students and teachers, living conditions, and were surprisingly open to me.  Naturally they talked about girls, which had its ups and downs. At one point after one of them was describing a girl, I said in Swahili, “Oh, so she looks just like you?” and the kids LOST it.  I’m sure I got bonus laughs for being a foreigner but subtle digs and comedic relief in semi-uncomfortable conversations still feel like small wins.  Despite the occasional super non politically correct (maybe even immoral) comments, the students still cheered me up.  They made me laugh and make me feel welcomed.  </p>

<p>After the conversation, I got changed and started playing basketball with some students.  Shortly into the game, I stepped on someones foot and my ankle popped.  I layed down in pain for a good long while and hobbled home.  I called the Peace Corps medical office, got a ride to the nearest hospital, and got an X-ray.  No broken bones, just a dislocated ankle.  After getting some painkiller in my ankle, they popped it back into place and I felt 100% due to the extremely strong painkiller.  That night, I had trouble sleeping from the pain and the next day I could barely walk.  When the Peace Corps office called to check in, they told me they want to arrange for me to travel to Dar Es Salaam to get inspected by our PC doctors.  Roller coasters are designed start off scary and then get more enjoyable after the initial fears wear off.  The past two rides I’ve been on have ended in puke. I guess this day genuinely depicts a PJ Gibson roller coaster experience. </p>

<h3 class="major">Dar Es Salaam</h3>

<p> Flew into Dar on a Thursday.  The plane was a little bumpy but I got free cashews and a tiny bottle of wine.  Flying through the thick clouds and experiencing turbulence got my nerdy brain thinking about the physics of clouds, which sparked a few physics fun fact topics.  I arrived at Dar, chatted it up with my Peace Corps driver about Chelsea and Arsenal, and got to the doctor.  The doctor was nice, but was very adamant in letting me know there was no way it was a dislocation and it was only a sprain.  Made me feel like a total wimp.  Got diagnosed a ankle brace and less wimpy attitude, and I was on my way to my hostel by 2:00pm.  I was lucky enough to be in Dar at the same time as another volunteer so we grabbed a cheap bite and then went to drinks / ping pong / pool at a nearby Holiday Inn.  </p>

<p>The next day, I got checked out by the Peace Corps office and they realized that I was a weakling who certainly was not dying.  I went back after a very short checkup and asked to leave Dar on Sunday as to explore the area a little bit.  They agreed.  My new friend had already been in Dar for a few days, so he didn’t want to spend money.  Therefore, I took myself out on a solo date to ice cream and Indian food.  Turns out this PJ dude is pretty cool, although he shouldn’t have eaten so much food.  “No Ragrets”</p>

<p>Saturday, my last full day in Dar was pretty fun!  I took myself on a second date to an amazing breakfast plate and again, PJ ate a lot of food.  Too full to even fool around after the date.  Which is probably a good thing because right after eating, I went right to the PCVL apartments to hang out with some 3rd year Peace Corps extendees working with the office.  We played Settlers of Catan.  I won.  No big deal, just business.  After returning and doing some lesson-planning, I met up with another Peace Corps Volunteer from my cohort for drinks.  I had 2 Moscow mules at happy hour, saw a great sunset, and then we gorged ourselves with dumplings at an amazing Chinese place.  Went back to the hotel and left the following morning via bus.  Made it onto the bus about 2 minutes before it left.  10.5 hours later and I was back at my house, safe and sound.  </p>
