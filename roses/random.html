									<h2 class="major">My House</h2>
									
									<p><b><u>  One guy, big house </u></b> –   Having heard stories from my parents about living with other people, I expected to live with a host family the whole service.  This is not the case and all volunteers have their own living space (some have duplexes).  My house is very large and can accommodate guests.  I enjoy my own “me time” every once in a while and luckily the large house doesn’t freak me out.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Amenities </u></b> –   I got them.  I have electricity, running water (20% of the time), a gas stove,  and a refrigerator!  I also get 4G using the verizon-equivilant service provider of Tanzania.  It’s good enough service that using data from my phone, a hotspot, my laptop, a HDMI chord, and a projector, I was able to stream a live premier league game and project it onto my wall for myself and a few teachers to watch.  Nuts! </p> 
					
									<h2 class="major">Food</h2>

									<p><b><u>  Cooking by myself </u></b> –   I have enjoyed to cook independently.  Many Tanzanian men are shocked that I can fend for myself in this way, but I’m still standing so I can’t be doing too bad of a job.  There is an incredible Peace Corps cookbook (and an extra at my house) that I will be bringing back to the United States.  It is full of great recipes and has expanded my mind.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Snickers </u></b> –   is my favorite candy in country.  Every time I go into town, I buy a snickers bar, return home, put it in the refrigerator, and eat it the same night.  Now, almost every time I see Vern, she gets me a snickers and it is both cute and awesome.   </p> 


<p><b><u>  Kiti moto </u></b> –   which translates to “hot seat” is my favorite local food in country.  It is fried pork and has an interesting backstory for its name-origin. Muslims do not eat pork, so if they eat kiti moto, they are in the hot seat.  Most tanzanians love to hear me say that I like kiti moto, and I still don’t really know why.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Other local food </u></b> –   is also super good.  Rice/Ugali and beans is the most common local dish.  Some mamas in town make a mean rice and beans.  Additionally, a Zanzibari soup  called “urojo” gives kiti moto a running for my favorite local dish.   </p> 

<p><b><u> Stuff is cheap! </u></b> –   With a few exceptions like gasoline or electronics, most everything here is cheaper than in the United States.  Especially food.  For example, the flat price for a single avocado is equivalent to 22 cents.  Managing my money has been pretty simple so far, and if I start to run out I can always live on a small amount of money at site for a few weekends.  Spending time in Iringa Town or other large towns generally costs more.     </p> 

<p><b><u> Bargaining </u></b> –   is crucial.  In addition to things being cheaper in general, you can often reduce the price by bargaining with the seller.  A good rule of thumb is to cut their price in half and watch their reaction.  Doesn’t always work, but it’s a fun way to learn the language and integrate.  All of the locals bargain like it’s nothing.    </p> 

									<h2 class="major">Totally Random</h2>

<p><b><u>  Going with the flow </u></b> –   One huge rose/blessing is the newfound ability to go with the flow.  Turns out you can make plans super last second, and life goes on!  Certainly this isn’t a great approach to certain parts of life (like teaching), but with respect to traveling it’s a blast.  You don’t always need a rigid plan, and sometimes it’s really beneficial to have a loose plan or no plan at all!  How Peace Corps is that???       </p> 

<p><b><u>  People like when you talk in Swahili </u></b> –   When I go to the market and speak in swahili, I can often get a “zawadi” or present for speaking in Swahili.  One time when I was watching football at a bar with my counterpart, a stranger bought me 3 beers because he was so happy to hear me speaking the native language.    </p> 

<p><b><u>  Voice Messages </u></b> –   So voice messages through Whatsapp are awesome.  I get / receive a few each day, mostly from Vern and Lindsay.  They always cheer me up and keep me connected to the people closest to me.  </p>
