<p><b><u>  Intimidation  </u></b> –   It’s hard to get out of your comfort zone.  So talking to teachers who speak ridiculously quickly in a different language can be hard.  Also, I am significantly younger than all of my fellow teachers and closer to my students age.  While I think I let my teaching speak for myself gaining respect is one thing that sometimes lingers in the back of my mind.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Large class sizes  </u></b> –   Your teaching style options are limited with class sizes of 95 and 142.  Complications include:  noise, hard to organize, group work is hard, memorizing names, visibility of board/projector, marking.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Tests are hard  </u></b> –   Imagine taking a physics test with no notes for equations.  There are 10 different topics that could range from gravitation to surface tension to heat.  There are 10 questions, each with parts a, b, and c.  Each of those has Roman numerals I, II, and III following them.  You need to memorize several definitions.  Also the questions are in a different language and often poorly worded.  I often wonder how I would perform on these tests.  Apart from the sections I’ve mastered, I don’t know how I would do on one of these tests.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  High expectations  </u></b> –   I have often heard students told that they are wasting their time if they aren’t in class or studying.  They are required to stay on school grounds every weekend except for one each month and need a pass to go into town.  If you fail, you often get corporally punished.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Chapa  </u></b> –   While it is much more scaled back that many schools I’ve heard of, and our students are older males, corporal punishment is hard to watch. Students don’t want to be hit, and seeing something painful forced on someone against their will is difficult to react to.  Often I will remove myself from the situation but if I am around it, I can notice it’s subconscious effect on my mood.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  General student health concerns  </u></b> –   Students have shared living spaces that I would not enjoy to live in, get less than 5 hours of sleep every night, have the same types of food every day, and are required to fetch water about 1km away for drinking, bathing, and flushing.  Soap isn’t as common as you’d hope for a toilet paper-less society.  Also plumbing isn’t too wonderful.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Unwanted neighbors  </u></b> –   I’m talking about my mouse.  There’s a mouse in the house and several lizards.  Even saw a camel spider once.  Killed that SOB.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Laundry </u></b> –   Though my laundry thorn isn’t as painful as Vern’s (she HATES it), it is not enjoyable.  My two solutions are either tutor a student friend in exchange for his laundry skills or pay an elderly village woman to do it for me. Not a bad thorn for me.   </p>
