						<!-- Content -->
<p><b><u>  Gender Roles  </u></b> –  This is probably the biggest thorn, and I’m a guy.  I listen to female volunteers, but I’ll never fully understand what it must be like for them. I thought about making an entire page on this one.  I think it would make me really sad if I did.  I’m going to bullet some of the biggest challenges associated with gender roles.  I definitely have not hit all of them, but this is what popped into my head.  </p>
<ul>
<li>  Religion – Some say the bible says men are born to lead women </li>
<li>  Cheating culture – People (mostly men I think) have multiple secret partners. </li>
<li>  Talk to the man – If me and a female volunteer are together, people will often speak to me when my friend can clearly speak for herself</li>
<li> Bride Price – you pay the family of the bride to marry her.  Can lead to less than consensual partnerships. </li>
<li>  Abusive admiration – Chris Brown is the most popular American artist here.  R. Kelly is up there.  The most popular artist, Diamond Platinumz, has also been known to hit women.  </li>
<li>  Clothing – most all female volunteers can only wear shorts when in an entirely private setting, lest face judgment. </li>
<li>  Marriage – people get married early and are criticized if they aren’t </li>
<li>  The white woman – many male peers inquire me about hooking them up with American white women </li>
<li>  Act differently – people just in general act very differently in front of men and women. </li>
<li>  Professionalism in workplace – I get asked if I think other female teachers are attractive. </li>
<li>  The worst one – At other schools, it is too frequent the case that a male teacher is having a sexual relationship with a young female student.  The punishment for the teacher is typically moving schools or a demotion. </li>
<li>  Role in house – fully expected to cook, clean, raise children. </li>
<li>  Need to find Tanzanian woman – male peers want me to find a Tanzanian woman who will take care of me.  Also that way, I will stay in Tanzania.</li>
</ul> 

<p><b><u>  Animal cruelty  </u></b> –  In general, dog’s are a whole lot meaner here, partially because humans aren’t that nice to them.  Little kids regularly throw sticks or small rocks at dogs/cats.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Personal space  </u></b> –  You will touch the person on the bus next to you.  If you are in line, someone is likely grazing your butt because they are so close.  Maybe I just have a nice butt. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Drop toilets  </u></b> –  Because nearly all bathrooms are drop toilets, and these aren’t quite as sanitary as western toilets, bathrooms smell pretty bad.  Bathrooms smell really bad.  You get used to it though.  I think I might cry when I use a McDonalds bathroom and it smells nicer than the one in my house. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Garbage fires  </u></b> –  There’s no garbage truck that drives around.  Therefore, there’s lots of litter and people remove their own garbage by burning it.  The first time the smoke wafted into my home-stay room, I immediately got sick.  It has to have countless negative health effects and I get sad when I see children playing around these fires.</p> 

<p><b><u>  Betting  </u></b> –  I’m sure it’s a challenge I just haven’t seen as much of in the states, but sports betting is wildly popular.  I fear that many people lose lots of money from this habit. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Unhealthy alcohol consumption  </u></b> –  Again, I’m sure it’s a challenge I just haven’t seen as much of in the states, but it seems more socially acceptable to drink very frequently.  People who don’t are often viewed as not cool. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Wealth  </u></b> –  Many students pick careers on the sole basis of making lots of money.  Again, sure this happens in America. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Self Deprecation  </u></b> –  There’s a common theme of people wanting to leave Tanzania to go to America because “everything is better there”.  I wish they could see some of the lovely things I see in Tanzania. </p>
