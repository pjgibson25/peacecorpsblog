<p><b><u>  Intricacy of cursing  </u></b> –  After a long day of travel, I accidentally took this man’s seat on a bus.  When I got up to move I said something along the lines of “just my fucking luck”.  He thought I cursed him out cause he “knew English”.  He wanted to hit me and it made for a very tense / uncomfortable bus ride.  You take for granted the intricacies of English cursing. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Swahili / local dialects  </u></b> –  It is pretty hard to completely learn Swahili.  Throw in the fact that many locals speak a combination of Swahili and local tongues makes it even tougher. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Staring  </u></b> –  You get stared at.  A lot.  Little kids can stare at you for minutes straight without breaking eye-contact.  Sometimes I want to explain to them that if you stare at the wrong person in the United States, you can get into a fight.  I don’t.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Tourism warps perspectives of wealth  </u></b> –  Most people are taught early on that white people / foreigners have money.  This means that people often ask me for money, food, my watch, or anything on my person.  It’s only semi-heartbreaking when a 7 year old kid comes up to you all cute and then tells you in English, “give me money.”  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Mzunugu!  </u></b> –  This word means foreigner but has connotations of “white person”.  Kids yell it when you walk by and you get described as it by anyone and everyone.  It was more of a frustration at the beginning of training, but it serves as a reminder that you clearly are not a local/Tanzanian. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Comparisons  </u></b> –  My site is a replacement site.  This means I’ve had a few volunteers before me.  Teachers or other people in the area will often talk about the other volunteers or draw comparisons with me.  Along with the word mzungu, I think these comparisons serve as a complication in the desire to be recognized as an individual.  </p>
