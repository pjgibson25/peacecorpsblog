<p><b><u>  Work Permits </u></b> –   Due to complications in getting our work permits, there is a chance that my time in Tanzania will be cut short.  Trying to stay optimistic. If we do not have them by June, we will have to leave after a little less than 1 year in country. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Lack of time </u></b> –   Sometimes students will come up to me and ask for extra review sessions or extra classes to move through units faster.  I wish that I could indulge these students, but there are several students who need me to continue at my current pace (maybe even slower) and I just don’t have the time to move faster.  I hold myself to the standard that for each lesson, I need to become and expert on the topic.  Students come to me with questions out of their own textbooks and I always want/need to be able to answer their questions.  Lack of time can be hard. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Time management </u></b> –   Piggy-backing off of  the previous statement, it is hard to manage my time.  Spending time outside of site, at site, with teachers, with students, with volunteers, working out or playing sports, by myself watching some show on my computer, cleaning, exploring, writing lessons, planning club meetings, writing grants (haven’t done this), working on my blog, or sleeping.  There are 100 things to balance, and sometimes I worry that I could be managing my time better. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Meetings </u></b> –   Imagine the how the Grinch reacts to all of the noise.  The noise noise noise noise.  Now channel his energy and that’s how I feel about meetings.  They’re long, people talk fast, I usually don’t understand too much, and if I didn’t already mention it, they’re LONG!  I do my best to go to the mandatory ones but will always pass on the optional ones.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Long, uncomfortable bus rides </u></b> –   For the most part, I enjoy traveling long distances by bus in Tanzania.  However, if you’re in a rush and end up standing on a jam-packed bus, it can get really uncomfortable really quickly.  Personal space does not exist on a crowded bus. </p> 

<p><b><u> Pit stops </u></b> –   Whenever you travel anywhere, it is likely that your car or bus will make a few more stops than you’d prefer.  Usually it is to pick up more customers, but sometimes you don’t even know why.  This is something that was very frustrating at first, but I have adapted to. </p> 

<p><b><u> Travel Complications </u></b> –   Here’s a list of some of the more severe travel complications that have happened to me.  After a while, you just start assuming something might happen. </p> 

<ul>
<li>  Bus breaks down #1→ 1 hour waiting for repair on route to Iringa </li>
<li>  Bus breaks down #2 → 20 min waiting for repair on route to Nyololo</li>
<li>  Bus breaks down #3 → 4 hours waiting for repair </li>
<li>  Bus breaks down #4 → 15 min waiting for repain on route to Njombe Town </li>
<li>  Other truck jackknifed in road → 1 hour trying to get it unstuck</li>
<li>  Sold false tickets → Not a straight route as promised, different destination.  Stayed night at halfway point. </li>
<li>  VIP passing→ 30 min stop waiting for high ranking official to pass by </li>
<li>  Crash #1 → small collision on route to Korogwe</li>
<li>  Crash #2 → small collision on route to Vern’s place</li>
</ul> 


<p><b><u>  Marking exams </u></b> –   So marking exams in general kinda sucks.  It’s made harder by the very large class sizes.  This means a bunch of time.  Every once in a while the teachers will have students in different classes mark the other classes’ scores. </p> 


<p><b><u>  A place to poo </u></b> –   It sucks when you  need to poo and don’t have the time to find a spot.  You see someone’s true colors when they’re in this state of panic.  Irene told me to go whenever you have the chance.  Good advice from a well-traveled older sister. </p>
