<p><b><u>  Tanzania </u></b> – is a gorgeous country with a rich and diverse culture.  Each day, I am happy with my decision to apply to Tanzania specifically.  It’s pretty neat that the first time I travelled across country to my site, I saw zeebras, giraffes, elephants, wildebeests, and  gazelles.</p>

<p><b><u>  Iringa </u></b> – is pretty centrally located in Tanzania.  This means that most all places I can reach within a day (that’s 24 hours).  There are a plethora of volunteers within a 8 hour journey of me, so visiting other sites or going on cheap vacations is made very easy.  </p>

<p><b><u>  Tosamaganga is beautiful & safe. </u></b> – Not too much more to add to this.  I mean check out the picture above! This is where I live.  Even the architecture of the school itself is gorgeous.  </p></p>

<p><b><u>  Watching weather </u></b> – is made easy by the fact that Tosa is perched on a hill that overlooks a massive valley.  That means I can watch thunderstorms or massive rainstorms from afar staying perfectly dry and perfectly safe.  The weather is fairly similar to that of Oregon, which I love.  I’m not dying in the heat of coastal Tanzanian regions which is a huge blessing. </p>

<p><b><u>  Watching falcons </u></b> – A fair amount of falcons live close by to Tosamaganga.  That means that I can stand on a widow’s peak nested on top of the biology building and watch falcons hunt other birds.  They are incredible creatures.  </p></p>


<p><b><u>  Iringa Town  </u></b> – is awesome.  It is fairly large with lots to do.  It has a popping night life, and has been known as the party region of Tanzania.  Volunteers from neighboring regions love Iringa Town, and will travel reasonably far to visit it on special occasions or long weekends.  Many volunteers traveling to their site from more northern regions need to pass through Iringa Town as well and often spend a night or two.  There is a ton of great food at the market, plenty of wonderful restaurants by TZ standards, and many “safi dukas” or shops that sell American goods such as snickers or granola.  </p>

<p><b><u>  Proximity to Town.  </u></b> – So I have a site that is a little less than one hour from town with frequent transportation from 7:00am to 7:00pm.  That’s nuts!  Because I am close to town, I can see volunteers passing through Iringa, which means I see other PCV’s a lot.  So much for being super lonely.  Some volunteers like Vern have to travel 3 hours on a bus that makes the trip once or twice a day.  One volunteer even has a 7 hour transportation to the nearest large town.  </p>

<p><b><u>  Traveling </u></b> – is super easy.  Because Iringa is large and centrally located there are countless buses that pass through it.  That means traveling is as simple as flagging down a large bus (if you’re less lucky you get a small bus) that is heading in the direction you want to go.  If it’s a very important trip maybe you even buy a ticket the day ahead of time.  </p>
