In what might have been one of my best ever soccer performances, I racked up 2 goals (one was awesome) in our 3-1 win.</h4>

<p><b><u>  Football (soccer) is popular? </u></b> – Who would have thought?  I see jerseys everywhere.  People play anywhere using anything.  The students who play at my school are really good.  I think they are the best out of the 885 boys aged 18-21 who attend Tosamaganga secondary.  That’s why I play basketball instead so I can feel better about myself.  Striking up conversations with strangers is made easier by the fact that there’s a good chance you can fall back on a soccer-themed conversation topic.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Balling out like Lebron </u></b> –   is something I look forward to most days.  I play basketball with a group of students on the court nestled within school grounds.  Not to sound cocky but it’s not uncommon to rack up a triple double.  It does help that I’m about 70th percentile for height here…  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Frisbee </u></b> –   is catching on quick!  I started evening toss-arounds in early January.  Since then, the number of interested students has only increased.  A few of them want to start a club, and I’m not opposed in the slightest.  Looks like something I’m going to end up doing.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Volleyball </u></b> –   is my last resort.  If people aren’t playing frisbee, basketball, or soccer (in that order), I always can join in on a volleyball session.  Having so many older boys who love sports is a really wonderful blessing and is helping me show face when I don’t feel particularly extroverted.   </p>
