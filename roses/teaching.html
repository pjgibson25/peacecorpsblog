									<h2 class="major">Tosamaganga</h2>
									<p><b><u>  A-level schools (form V-VI) </u></b> – require all teachers to at least have a bachelor’s degree.  This means that the staff is well educated and qualified to teach students.  O-level schools (forms I-IV) have no such requirement.  This leads to some frustration from other volunteers about teachers not understanding the material they teach or not showing up to school at all.   </p>

<p><b><u>  Tosamaganga boys </u></b> – are what I’d like to call the cream of the crop.  Failed national exams taken in Form II and Form IV remove the vast majority of the initial student population from the education system entirely.  Therefore, the students that are left by Form V are ones that have passed their exams and are motivated enough to learn or at least work the system.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  School Parades </u></b> – occur every Friday morning starting abruptly at 7:30am.  Students assemble in the main courtyard, sing the national anthem, a patriotic song or two, the school song, have a student speech, teachers give various announcements, and then the scouts do some sort of cool thing.  Sometimes they march, sometimes they do karate type stuff, but for the most part it’s bad-ass and only a little funny.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Child Labor </u></b> – is a bad thing…in most all cases.  However, part of the school culture in Tanzania is that students do various work for teachers free of charge.  Many students think of it as an honor to do work for their teachers including carrying their materials places or bringing them buckets of water.  I’m not quite sure how the 18-21 year old boys at my school view it…maybe not an honor.  But when I haven’t taken a shower in a few days or manually flushed my toilet, having a few boys bring me buckets of water feels like a blessing to me.  I promise I’m not a horrible person I think.  Just integrating! </p> 

<p><b><u>  Weekday lunches are free </u></b> – which is pretty neat.  We always have beans.  The main starch is always either rice or ugali (a traditional tanzanian food).  One day we get leafy greens, one day we get bananas, one day we get meat, and one/two days we get a traditional cabbage-like topping.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Tosa chapa isn’t too bad comparatively. </u></b> – So chapa is corporal punishment.  For boys at our school, this means getting hit on the backside with a stick.  There are laws that limit the number of times they can be hit.  Our school obeys these laws and many teachers like my counterpart employ other punishments such as community labor.  Hearing stories from other volunteers makes me thankful that the Tosa staff obeys the laws and is moving towards other punishment alternatives.  </p> 

									<h2 class="major">Teaching</h2>
									<p><b><u>  Teaching is fun! </u></b> – I really do enjoy that work that I am doing.  I spend countless hours preparing notes, making my own practice problems, organizing review sessions, prepping computer science club, reviewing notes, and thinking of new ways to reach the students.  I am thankful that I love the work that I am doing with Peace Corps.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Good students! </u></b> – Having made it to Form V/VI, the students at my school are the cream of the crop.  Their English proficiency makes it that much easier to plan and implement my class plans.  They have an incredibly strong drive to succeed and they work more than I ever did in high school.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Resources </u></b> – are one thing that not all Tanzanian schools have.  My school has outlets in many of the classrooms, electricity almost all the time, a projector, a printer, a copier, and government funds to do building renovations.  I sometimes feel too lucky to have received all the resources and blessings I got when assigned to Tosamaganga.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Fun facts of the day </u></b> – are one thing that my students and I always look forward to.  Beginning in January, I implemented a fun physics fact of the day to start every class with.  These range from explaining how space is big and empty to asking, “Would you rather be 15 feet away from a grenade on land or be 15 feet away from a grenade underwater?”  These fun facts give me a chance to show how physics can be interesting and applicable to real life.  They remind me why I love physics and hopefully some of that excitement rubs off on the students. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Nimedamsha! </u></b> – This roughly translates to “I look smart!”  Teaching along with a more conservative dressing culture has forced me to wear more professional clothes.  And I kinda like it.  </p>
