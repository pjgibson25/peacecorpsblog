<p><b><u>  My First “Drop Toilet” </u></b> –   When we arrived in korogwe, we stayed in hostels for the first few nights.  My room had a bathroom attached.  Inside was a regular looking toilet, but there was no seat.  Having heard of drop toilets that you needed to squat all the way down for, I thought I had discovered my first.  After all, it didn’t have a seat.  When describing to people in the same guest house that I had a drop toilet, they were all curious.  They had regular toilets.  After some inspection and a real-life example of how I perched my feet up on the rim of the toilet, they laughed for minutes straight.  Turns out drop toilets are built into the ground, don’t look like western toilets without seats, and I’m an idiot.  Still haven’t lived this one down. </p> 

<p><b><u>  My First Joke </u></b> –   One morning in Korogwe (at my home-stay) I woke up to find a cockroach, or “mende” in Swahili, squirming upside down right next to my bed.  I took a bucket bath and returned to find it in the same predicament.  Naturally, I put it out of its misery using some bug spray, and then left it there.  In my Swahili lesson that day I asked how to say “My friend has passed away” in Swahili.  I went home and told my host family dad that my friend had passed away.  His face turned incredibly empathetic.  I then told him to follow me.  I led him into my room and pointed at the bug.  I said his name is Nelson.  Nelson “mende”-la.  That was my first pun and joke in Swahili.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Too Much of a Good Thing </u></b> –  Mandazi are essentially fried balls of dough roughly the size of a child’s fist (weird description but I wanna say its accurate).  I’d call them donuts but they’re not quite as good.  Regardless, my home-stay mama made some pretty mean mandazi.  One day she was cooking them, I was sitting with her, and I was popping them in my mouth fresh.  After feeling quite full after 5, she told me I hadn’t eaten dinner.  Just snacks.  So dinner was an additional 2 mandazi with some beans.  That night I puked.  Mandazi hasn’t ever been the same, but my tally of 7 in one night is nearly unparalleled among volunteers.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Scorpion </u></b> –   One time at homestay a scorpion-looking thing was running on the ground towards me.  My mama killed it before it got to me.  Later that night I walked past where the devilish creature had died and felt something on the ground.  I jumped super high in the air.  Turns out it was just a little bit of food someone had dropped.  My whole family laughed at me and the house girl, who has the most contagious laugh ever, never let me live that one down.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  Limbwata </u></b> –   My home-stay mama really wanted to make sure I was prepared for anything when I went to site.  She asked me, “What will you do if a Tanzanian woman wants to do your laundry and cook for you?”  I told her that would be awesome, I’d just tell her that we were just friends.  She told me that if I let that happen, she’d slip me some limbwata.  I didn’t know what that was so she told me to ask Paul, my language trainer.  Turns out limbwata is a witch doctor love drug that makes a man instantly fall in love with a woman.  All she needs to do is bring a piece of my hair to a witch doctor, they produce some powder, I eat the powder, and then I’m madly in love with the woman who gave it to me.  Turns out in addition to consuming it, if she knows that I typically pee on a specific bush, she can sprinkle the limbwata on the bush and after I pee on the mixture, I’ll fall in love with her.  Crazy stuff, think I’m in the clear so far, but will keep you all updated.  </p>


<p><b><u>  The “Local Fence” </u></b> –   My first weekend at site, I helped my head of physics department, Mwl. Mashiku, build a fence using straw, sticks, and wire.  He called it a local fence.  After about 4.5 hours of hard work, I was tired of working and ready for dinner.  I was perfectly okay preparing my own meal but he assured me that his wife was making us some food.  About an hour later, we get called in for dinner.  The meal:  Ugali Dagaa, my least favorite meal in all of Tanzania.  Dagaa is essentially just anchovies only more gross.  At the time, I was devastated.  Now, I can look back on it and laugh.   </p> 

<p><b><u>  Jesus Music </u></b> –   Okay so it’s not super funny but whenever you take crowded public transportation, there’s a 50% chance that the bus is playing music too loud and a 15% chance that the music is gospel (and also super loud).  Imagining how absurd this would be in the United States makes me chuckle 100% of the time.  A few songs have even become inside jokes with me and Lindsay.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  HTNBAI </u></b> –   So one week, I assigned a group homework assignment.  12 questions, one week, answers in the back of a packet I gave them.  About 20% of the students turned it in.  My response:  A 40 minute PowerPoint lecture on how not to be an idiot (HTNBAI).  It was very well-received and ended up being a lot of fun / well-worth the time.  The best part was the exit slip.  All students had to anonymously fill out a small sheet of paper answering the question “What did you learn today?”  Here are some of my favorite responses as they appeared on the paper.   </p>
<ul>
<li>  My weaknesses </li>
<li>  “You need to think big as to get big” </li>
<li>I real like Sir Gibson. </li>
<li>How to not be an Idiot </li>
</ul> 


<p><b><u>  A kind offer </u></b> –   One day a student stayed after class to ask me a question, or at least I thought it was a question.  He opened up his book and there was a picture of a woman with a bindi (colored dot typically worn by Hindus) on her forehead.  It was a really good drawing.  In bubble letters above the picture, he had written “INDIAN”.  He then proceeded to ask me for a picture of myself so that he could draw me.  I told him that I could give him one next class, but received no follow-up.  All in all it was a very strange interaction but pretty funny nonetheless. </p> 

<p><b><u>  Little Houdini </u></b> –   Kenta and I visited our home-stay families over winter break.  We were hanging out and Kenta’s home-stay brother was being annoying and craving attention.  That’s why Kenta decided to tie him to a table, hands & feet (see picture above).  He loved the attention during the tying up process but didn’t love it when he realized he definitely could not get out.  He cried (a go to move for him) and eventually after some giggles we let him out.  Guess all Houdini needed to do was cry until someone helped him out, seems like an effective strategy. </p> 


<p><b><u>  You Sick? Let’s get turnt </u></b> –   One night I had food poisoning.  It was 11:30pm on a Wednesday night during the school week  and I was puking in my bathroom.  With a bucket in hand, I texted my counterpart, Kambo, that I was sick and just threw up.  Don’t know why.  He immediately called me and told me he’d come over right away.  Turns out I need to “enjoy”.  He shows up in his car and drives me to his friends house nearby.  He and two of his friends each bought me a beer that was “waiting for me”.  I told them I really didn’t want any beer.  They told me just to try one.  I had 2 sips and gave the rest to my counterpart.  We watched the second half of the Manchester United vs. Manchester City match.  They offered me food but I didn’t want any… I had food poisoning.  I returned around 1:00am and puked some more.  Fun night.  A week later, I find out it was all a test to see if I was really feeling sick.  I passed.  </p> 

<p><b><u>  PJ Trebek </u></b> –   After break, I used a phone hotspot, my laptop, a projector, and a nice interactive online website to create and then play a physics review jeopardy game with my students.  There were a few physics themed categories and then a few fun categories, one of which was called American Culture.  When the question, “What is the most popular sport  in America?” arrived, the 5 student contestants seemed eager to respond.    </p> 
<ul>
<li>  Guess 1:  Basketball </li>
<li>  Guess 2:  Soccer</li>
<li>  Guess 3:  Rugby</li>
<li>  Guess 4:  Baseball</li>
<li>  Guess 5:  Volleyball</li>
</ul> 
<p>  I told them that the answer was American Football.  They didn’t believe me.  So I gave them a respectful follow up, “Raise your hand if you were born and have lived in the United States…….oh I’m the only one?  I guess I’m right then.”  Turns out teaching can be easy when you run a classroom dictatorship. </p>
