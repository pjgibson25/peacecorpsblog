									<h3 class="major">Family</h3>
                                                                        <p><b><u> Mom & Dad </u></b> –  did Peace Corps before it was cool :) all reproduction jokes aside, I wouldn’t be where I am without them.  Their stories about funny Peace Corps memories and the experience’s effect on their lives inspired me to become a volunteer.  Their constant love and support throughout my childhood is a blessing you cannot assign value to and it inevitably helped me not become a complete loser.  Also, in hindsight, thanks for not letting me get a snake.  I could have turned out to be a snake person and let’s just say I’m glad I’m not a snake person.  Thank you so much for your continued love and support.  I cannot give either of you enough thanks, I love you both! </p>

<p><b><u> Lauren & Irene </u></b> –  are my super smart, super cool sisters.  Irene, I really admire your bravery and selflessness in spending so much time abroad to help people where help is needed.  Being here has hopefully helped me gain some insight to some of your experiences, but I’m sure I’ll never truly understand everything you see and do.  I really appreciate your advice and support.  Lauren, we don’t talk as much as we probably should, but whenever we’re together we have a great time.  After visiting Gombe and starting to read Jane Goodall’s “In the Shadow of Man”, it’s CRAZY to think you two are pals.  It’s amazing how you have found something that you are so passionate about and pursue it with such determination and excellence.  I really look up to you and Irene, and I love you both!  Thank you <3 </p>



									<h2 class="major">Volunteers</h2>
									<p>Out of all of the communities that I have been a part of, the Peace Corps Tanzania community stands alone.  Most volunteers are not only friendly but also incredibly interesting.  They come from all over the United States, even a few duel-citizenship citizens who have lived their whole life abroad.  Here, I’ll highlight some of the volunteers that have had a large impact on my experience.  I feel bad about not including more volunteers because so many have had profound impacts on my experience, but I'd prefer to spare you from reading a novel.  Here goes nothing! </p>


									<p> <b><u>Calista</u></b> – is the one of the first people I met in Washington DC and we immediately became the closest of friends.  She comes from rural Wisconsin, is incredibly kind, and has a hilarious accent. </p>

									<p> <b><u>Kenta</u></b> – lived close to me during Pre-Service Training and we spent many hours every day together.  He made long days shorter, is a great friend, and can sleep in almost any environment.</p>

									<p> <b><u>Lindsay</u></b> –  is a fellow mid-westerner who bailed to go to college in the PNW.  Funny enough, she ended up in Iringa so she’s stuck with me for the whole roller coaster ride.  She is my partner in crime, best friend, and the person who you’ll probably see in half of my pictures. </p>

									<p> <b><u>Vern</u></b> – and I started dating in early November.  The 5 hour commute to Njombe + the 2.5 or 3 hour trek to her crazy-rural site is well worth it.  Vern is a year into her service, embodies a great volunteer, has powered through challenges all-the-while remaining optimistic, and is a joy to be around.  I aspire to be more like her and reflect her kindness to others. </p>

									<p> <b><u>Travel Squad</u></b> – Over December break, I traveled with three good friends:  Abby, Jess, and Cade.  We had the chance to share many incredible experiences together, including seeing wild chimpanzees!  I’m incredibly thankful for this easy-going and terrific group of people. </p>

									<p> <b><u>Party Squad</u></b> – So there are a few people who bring out the party in me here.  First, there’s Chase.  She and I ran our very own zumba class at the end of PST and her wild dancing / Annie (the musical) impressions really brings out the party in me.  Next, there’s Cam.  Cam is my favorite DJ in the cohort, plays Frisbee with me, and generally is a “fun guy” to be around.  He also has some killer lip-syncing / stage-performing abilities.  Dude pumps me up.  Wesley is the last of this gang.  The Georgian native is a lovable computer geek but loves egging me on to keep the night alive.  Thankful to have him in Iringa with me.   </p>

									<h2 class="major">Teachers</h2>

<p> This section will first include teachers who I am particularly close with at my current school.  It will then include incredible teachers that I had in the United States who I never gave enough thanks to.  Their qualities both inside and outside of the classroom have inspired me, and they deserve to know the impact and influence they have had on me. </p>

<p><b><u> School Head Office </u></b> – includes my headmaster and his two second-masters.  All of them are extremely welcoming and enjoy introducing me to visiting people of importance.  My headmaster has fashioned himself to my father figure here in Tanzania and gives me good advice to stay happy and healthy. </p>

<p><b><u>  Kambo </u></b> – is a general studies teacher and is my counterpart!  He’s a silly but very friendly man who enjoys to watch soccer and party with me.  He makes friends pretty much every place he goes and likely has over 1,000 contacts in his phone.  I am thankful that he pushes me outside of my comfort zone, helps me with anything, and always tries to include me. </p>

<p><b><u>  Mashiku </u></b> – is the head of the physics department and was my first good friend at Tosamaganga.  We watch soccer, crack jokes, go on hikes, and have built a “local fence” together.  He is always a calming yet confident presence in the room, and is a great person to be friends with. </p>

<p><b><u>  Francis </u></b> – is a geography teacher who is also the sports officer at our school.  We play basketball together, he always invites me to things, and he is always incredibly friendly to me.  </p>

<p><b><u>  Paul </u></b> – was my LCF, the clown who taught me Swahili.  He is super funny, never got tired of my poop jokes (in Swahili nonetheless), and was a great teacher.  He knows the structures of Swahili like the back of his hand, and is extremely proficient in English.  I gave him plenty of thanks already, but he deserves all of it.  Dude is special.  </p>

									<p><b><u>  Physics Department </u></b> – contains 5 people including myself.  They are incredibly hard workers and like to chat through the day while they power through preparing notes or marking exams.  Boaz and Tippe are particularly nice presences in the department.</p>

									<p><b><u>  ---------------------------------------- </u></b></p>


									<p><b><u> Jed Rembold </u></b> – was a teacher throughout my entire Willamette University experience.  He integrates coding into his teaching, employs creative class structures, produces the most incredible themed examinations, supports students outside of the classroom, has a clear passion for teaching, teases his students in a fun way, and creates the most frustratingly simple yet difficult multiple choice questions.  Without a doubt, he had a profoundly positive impact on my college experience and continues to have an impact on my teaching at Tosamaganga.  Thank you 1,000 times over! </p>

									<p><b><u> Rick Watkins </u></b> – was another teacher who taught me all four years at Willamette University.  He is extremely kind, approachable, and perhaps most importantly, goofy.  I remember and try to mirror his enthusiasm both in lecturing and in representing physical phenomenon by running around in front of the class.  I’ll never forget his supportive nature (“you got this!”) or his ability to put down any work when a student comes to him with a question.  Thank you Rick! </p>

									<p><b><u> Peter Beck </u></b> – was my high school Algebra teacher.  At the time, I’m sure that I was a frustrating student because didn’t exert myself as much as I should have.  However, I learned more in his class about creative/critical thinking with respect to STEM than I did in my entire educational career.  Mr. Beck never lost faith in me and continued to push me which ultimately brought me to where I am today.  Thank you, Mr. Beck, I really appreciate you. </p>

									<p><b><u> Willamette Physics Department </u></b> – Apart from Jed and Rick, I am grateful for the rest of the physics department.  I use Dr. Daniel Borrero’s multiple choice, foldable, paper sheet to increase student participation and help check for understanding.  I try to exemplify Dr. Michaela Kleinert’s drive to see her students succeed.  I also attempt to hold myself to the same standard that Dr. David Altman holds himself.  Thank you all for being such wonderful influences! </p>

Therefore, I’m going to list off all the people who deserve thanks as bullets.  I know it doesn’t do any of you justice. However, if you see your name and want to know why I think you’re a blessing, just ask!  </p>
